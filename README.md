# About
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused an uproar around the world, leading to an urgent need for accurate and true information, which sometimes makes the difference between life and death. However, in line with this deadly pandemic, it is the proliferation of false news. While pandemics and fake news are not new phenomena, an unprecedented moment in history is taking place today due to the post-digital age in which we live. Digital media allows for the prolific and repeated spread of false news during crises, when accurate and truthful information is needed. Consequently, people's ability to discern between fact and reality is diminishing, and things are so precarious that the main enemy of this pandemic is no longer the virus itself, but misinformation. The "COVIDInfo" app comes to the aid of this unprecedented situation, aiming to combat misinformation distorted with this pandemic, presenting information and statistics from reliable and verified sources, to ensure the most accurate information.
